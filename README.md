# Scandi-trading-data-project

The link below  is a zipped CSV file on AWS for 4 days' worth of tick data for 100 Scandinavian blue chip stocks. 
https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/itarlepublic/scanditicks/scandi.csv.zip 

The CSV has the following fields / columns:
1 = Bloomberg Code/Stock identifier
3 = Bid Price
4 = Ask Price
5 = Trade Price
6 = Bid Volume
7 = Ask Volume
8 = Trade Volume
9 = Update type => 1=Trade; 2= Change to Bid (Px or Vol); 3=Change to Ask (Px or Vol)
11 = Date
12 = Time in seconds past midnight
13 = Opening price
15 = Condition codes

Task
complete a report and send the findings to include the following data on a stock by stock (the individual unique stock codes are given in the first column) basis:
* Mean time between trades
* Median time between trades
* Mean time between tick changes
* Median time between tick changes
* Longest time between trades
* Longest time between tick changes
* Mean bid ask spread
* Median bid ask spread
* Examples of the round number effect - (both in traded values and traded volumes - i.e. is there an increased probability of the last digit on prices being a 0 compared to other last digits)                                                                                                   

Note: 
This data is over several days and so when no trading occurs there are large time gaps to take into account so as not to skew the figures. So you need to exclude auctions from the analysis. There should be c. 2 auctions a day - morning and afternoon. During this period you will see crossed spreads (i.e. bid price is larger than ask price) along with specific condition codes. I should only include the XT condition code (along with no condition code).
